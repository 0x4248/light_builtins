# Alternative build
If you want to build using sh instead of make, run the following command:
```bash
sh scripts/build_c.sh
sh scripts/build_cpp.sh
```
The binaries will be in the `bin` folder. C versions of the commands will be in the `bin/c` folder.

To clean the build, run the following command:
```bash
sh scripts/clean.sh
```
